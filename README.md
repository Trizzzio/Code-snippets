# Code-snippets

This repository contains a few code snippets used in my last research project. 

## code_stocks_france:

This file, coded in python, constructs all the necessary liquidity and volume proxies used in the empirical analysis of the paper "Multi-Market Effects of Financial Transaction Taxes"
for french stock data.

## code_options_france:

This file, coded in python, constructs all the necessary liquidity and volume proxies used in the empirical analysis of the paper "Multi-Market Effects of Financial Transaction Taxes"
for french option data.


## Double simulation with numerical optimization:

This file, coded in R, contains the simulation of the sequential model found in the paper "Multi-Market Effects of Financial Transaction Taxes". It produces as output 
prices, quantities, trading directions as well as updated probabilities of a simulated trading period that can be defined in the preample.

## Graphs Quoted Spread:

This file simply plots the quoted spreads produced using the output of the simulation above. Also coded in R.
